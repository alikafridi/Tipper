This app allows a user to enter the amount of bill, and then select what percentage of the bill they would like to tip. 

This is just a simple app I've made as a starter project as I begin programming Android applications.

The app I have here is a modified version of the app shown by Derek Banas in his Android Development Tutorial videos on Youtube. 
It has some functionalities that I have added from the code shown in the tutorial. 

The icon for the image was designed by Nishan Sothilingam and was found on iconfinder.com, where it is published under a free for commercial use license.

I also used PlaceIt by Breezi to produce the image of the screenshot on an android app.
